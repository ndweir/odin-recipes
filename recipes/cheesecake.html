        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Above we have a delicious homemade lemon cheesecake with a strawberry rhubarb swirl that is hard to mess up
            even for the most untalented home cook. It includes a gluten-free oreo crust making the whole cheesecake
            gluten-free. We hope you'll give our recipe a try! </p>
            
        <p> <strong>NOTE:</strong> While our cheesecake is gluten-free,
            it is <strong>NOT</strong> dairy free, sugar free or vegan.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoons of salted, melted butter</li>
            <li>1.25 cups of gluten-free Oreos (no cream)</li>
            <li>24 oz of cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 (14 oz) can of sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of pure lemon juice (optional)</li>
            <li>1 can of strawberry rhubarb preserves or conserve (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Brush melted butter on a springform pan that can fit in your air fryer (7 or 8 inches recommended)</li>
            <li>Mix the crushed Oreos with melted butter until the mixture has the texture of coarse meal,
                transfer the mixture to the springform pan and press evenly with a spoon to form a crust</li>
            <li>Using a stand or hand mixer, beat the cream cheese on medium until creamy and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.
                Add the eggs, condensed milk, vanilla, lemon juice and beat on medium speed until completely smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Put the pan with the crust in the air fryer and pour the cream cheese mixture over the crust.
                It should almost reach the rim of the pan.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the strawberry rhubarb conserve onto the cheese cake in blobs. Then using a knife or chopstick swirl the blobs.
                Be careful not to mix the strawberry rhubarb in too much.
            </li>
            <li>Bake the cheesecake at 300 degrees Fahrenheit until the top is lightly browned and the center jiggles slightly.
                About 25 to 35 minutes. It may take a little more or less time depending on the air fryer. </li>
            <li>Carefully remove the springform pan from the air fryer, let it sit at room temperature for about 1 hour,
                 and then cool it in the refrigerator for 6 to 8 hours. When ready to eat, remove the cheesecake from the pan. 
                 Slice with a warm knife, wiping it clean between cuts.</li>
        </ol>
