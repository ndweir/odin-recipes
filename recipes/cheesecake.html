<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Above we have a delicious homemade lemon cheesecake with a strawberry rhubarb swirl that is hard to mess up
        even for the most untalented home cook. It includes a gluten-free oreo crust making the whole cheesecake
        gluten-free. We hope you'll give our recipe a try! <strong>NOTE!</strong> While our cheesecake is gluten-free,
         it is <strong>NOT</strong> dairy free, sugar free or vegan (though substitutions to make the cheesecake dairy free, sugar free or vegan
             will be noted).
