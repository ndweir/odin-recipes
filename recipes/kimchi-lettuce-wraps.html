<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For the fastest path to deliciousness, select ingredients that 
        punch above their weight. This weeknight recipe leans on just 
        five primary ingredients — ground chicken, lettuce and rice 
        form the foundation; kimchi adds depth and hoisin lends 
        sweetness — for a fresh spread that cooks in just 15 minutes. 
        Bracing and assertive, kimchi doesn’t slip into this dish; it 
        dominates. Though each jar of kimchi is unique, its salty, 
        spicy and tangy notes reign. You’ll cook off a portion of 
        the chopped fermented cabbage with the chicken, taming its 
        taste and texture, then use the remainder as a garnish. 
        To offset kimchi’s assertiveness, the chicken is glazed 
        with hoisin sauce, which adds sweetness, color and 
        glossiness. Set the chicken mixture, kimchi, lettuce 
        and rice in separate bowls for tableside assembly — 
        less work for the cook, more fun for the guests.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ tightly packed cups store-bought or homemade kimchi (about 10 ounces)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chicken (preferably dark meat)</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons hoisin sauce, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>Lettuce leaves (preferably 2 heads bibb lettuce or 1 large head red-leaf lettuce)</li>
        <li>3 to 4cups warm cooked short-grain rice</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely chop the kimchi (or pulse in a food processor); 
            transfer about two-thirds to a small serving bowl, 
            reserving the remainder for the chicken.</li>
        <li>In a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil over 
            medium-high. Add the chicken, season with salt 
            and pepper, and cook, crumbling it occasionally 
            with a spoon, until starting to brown, about 5 
            minutes. Stir in the hoisin sauce and then the 
            reserved kimchi, and stir occasionally until 
            chicken is glossy and cooked through, about 4 
            minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken mixture, lettuce leaves and rice
             to separate serving bowls. Assemble lettuce wraps
              by first adding a spoonful of rice, then chicken
               mixture and then kimchi; devour swiftly. Serve 
               with more hoisin, if desired, for extra sweetness.</li>
